    For 5 years I have been a chemical process analyst at the Institute of
    Animal Physiology and Nutrition. My work consisted, among other things, of
    recalculating units and examining analysis results. 3 years ago I started to
    learn programming languages in order to improve repetitive analysis
    processes. After about a year of learning the basics of Java and JavaScript,
    in December 2018 I acquired the course "Full Stack Project: Spring Boot 2.0,
    ReactJS, Redux" on the basis of which I started writing the application 2
    months later.
